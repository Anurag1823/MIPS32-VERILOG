# MIPS32-VERILOG
VERILOG design of MIPS32 processor

5 stage pipelined design 32 bit Reduced Instruction Set Chip (RISC)  processor MIPS32.

No flag register ,it is assumed that word size is of 32 bits and only a subset of actual MIPS32 is implemented.

To avoid hazards dummy instruction are added.
